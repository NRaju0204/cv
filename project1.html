        <summary><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></summary>
    <p><em> 
        Dielectric Resonators offer attractive features such as low conductor losses, large 
        bandwidth, and high gain. Metamaterials offer unique properties that are not found in 
        nature, such as wide-angle scanning and excellent beam performance from the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio)" target="new">antenna</a>. Design strategies such as excitation of higher order modes and integration of 
        hybrid modes can be used to generate wide bandwidth. This paper presents an 
        investigation on the use of metasurfaces to enhance the performance of wideband 
        dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs). The metasurfaces are designed to operate in the 
        subwavelength regime and are placed in close proximity to the DRA to control the 
        radiation properties. The proposed metasurface-based DRA is shown to exhibit 
        enhanced radiation efficiency and bandwidth compared to a conventional DRA. The 
        effect of the metasurface design parameters on the antenna performance is also 
        analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed metasurface-based DRA can 
        achieve a wide bandwidth of more than 30% with a peak gain of 6 dBi. The proposed 
        antenna consists of a rectangular DRA with metasurface. The metasurface is an array 
        of (7x7) unit cells and each unit cell consists a ‘+’ shape. Antenna operates at the 
        9.5GHz frequencies and antenna   design achieves a gain of 2.5dBi at 7.5GHz frequency 
        and 4.1dBi at 8.25 GHz frequency and 4.1dBi at 9.56Ghz.The proposed antenna can 
        find applications in various wireless communication systems that require a wideband 
        and high-performance antenna.</em></p>

            <summary><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></summary>
            <p><em>Antenna is a device that transmits and/or receives electromagnetic waves. 
                Electromagnetic waves are often referred to as radio waves. Most antennas are resonant 
                devices, which operate efficiently over a relatively narrow frequency band. An antenna 
                must be tuned to the same frequency band that the radio system to which it is connected 
                operates in, otherwise reception and/or transmission will be impaired. An antenna is 
                specially designed to radiate or receive electromagnetic energy with directional and 
                polarization properties suitable for the intended function. An antenna, on transmissio n, 
                accepts energy from a source through a transmission line and radiates it into space and 
                on reception; it gathers energy from an incident wave and sends it down a transmission 
                line. 
                Wireless communications have grown at a very rapid pace across the world over the 
                last few years, which provide a great flexibility in the communication infrastructure of 
                environments such as hospitals, factories, and large office buildings. In order to meet 
                the increasing demands of mobile communication, major advancements in the fields of 
                antennas have occurred over the past decades, making this field the most vigorous and 
                dynamic in the engineering world. 
                An antenna gives the wireless system three fundamental properties - gain, direction, and 
                polarization. Gain is a measure of increase in power. Direction is the shape of the 
                transmission pattern. A good analogy for an antenna is the reflector in a flashlight.</em></p>

            <summary><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></summary>
            <P><EM>The dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) It has lots of attractive features such as low 
                cost,ease of excitation, and being bandwidth-controllable[1].Dielectric resonator 
                antennas are preffered over microstrip antenna because of high radiation efficiency due 
                to the absence of conductor losses[2]. In addition, DRA has the ability to avoid surface 
                waves which is another attractive feature in comparison with a microstrip 
                antenna.cylinder-shaped DRA are easy to fabricate when compare to other shaped 
                DRAs(like rectangular and hemispherical DRAs)[3].Now a days the circular polarized 
                antennas have gained more attention than linearly polarized antennas because of their 
                various applications in communications like RADAR,Broadcast,television etc.[4]. 
                Circularly polarized dielectric antennas are playing very important role in the modern 
                wireless communication systems[5].cylindrical dra is more popular in the market due 
                to its mature production of technology. We should know the fact that dielectric resonator 
                antenna and microstrip antenna are similar in many aspects like feeding mechanisms 
                ,radiation patterns[6].The performance of circularly polarized antennas are measure 
                using parameters like axial ratio, gain and beamwidth. circularly polarized antennas can 
                be designed by using helical antennas, patch antennas with a specially designed feed or 
                by using stacked patch antennas. 
                Metasurface is a two dimensional metamaterial,which are mostly used because of there 
                advantages such as low profile&multi mode operation[7].DRA placed over 
                metasurfaces,they help to enhance the gain and bandwidth of DRAs. These 
                Metasurfaces can be used to manipulate light in ways that are not possible with 
                conventional optical components. One of the most powerful applications of 
                Metasurfaces is the development of a wide range of functionalities, such as dynamic 
                beam steering, holography, and the control of light polarization. The MS can be found 
                in a broad range of applications, namely surface wave absorbers, surface waveguides, 
                cloaking, polarization converters, antennas, modulators, and so on[8]. 
                Designing and fabricating Metasurfaces is a complex process that requires careful 
                optimization of the unit cells and their arrangement. Recently, the use of deep 
                reinforcement learning (DRA) has emerged as an effective tool for optimizing 
                Metasurface designs.</EM></P>
