    <h3><strong>ðŸ‘‰ABOUT ME</strong></h3>
    <p size="15"><em>Hello, I'm <strong>Raju</strong>, a 22-year-old graduate from <ins>LENDI Institute of Engineering and Technology</ins>. With a deep passion for technology and <strong>software development</strong>, I aspire to become a skilled <strong>Dotnet+React <abbr title="Full stack developer">FSD</abbr></strong>. My journey began during my B.Tech program, where I honed my programming skills and gained a solid foundation in software development principles.

        The world of coding has always fascinated me, and I find joy in building innovative and efficient solutions to real-world problems. I am particularly drawn to the versatility of full stack development, where I can work on both the front-end and back-end aspects of a project, ensuring seamless user experiences and robust functionality.<br><br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I was fortunate enough to be placed at <strong>Hexaware</strong>, a renowned software company. This opportunity allows me to further enhance my skills and contribute to exciting projects alongside a talented team of professionals. I am enthusiastic about continually learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and frameworks in the software development industry.
        
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring different shades of blue, my favorite color, which symbolizes depth, stability, and limitless possibilities. I also enjoy staying active, reading tech blogs, and engaging in collaborative problem-solving activities.
        
        I'm thrilled to embark on this journey as a software engineer, leveraging my technical expertise and creative mindset to make a positive impact. If you share a passion for technology or have exciting project ideas,<strong> I would love to connect and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Let's build something extraordinaryÂ together!</strong>
