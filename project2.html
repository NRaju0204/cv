        Worldwide UHF RFID Applications </strong><br></h3>

        <summary><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></summary>
        <p><em> MICROSTRIP patch has been widely used in designing a circularly 
            polarized (CP) antenna due to its low profile and low cost. By etching an 
            asymmetric slot and loading a coupled strip at each side of a square patch, a CP 
            antenna of wide axial ratio (AR) beamwidth is obtained. The design in utilizes 
            the octagon-star shape to produce two orthogonal degenerated TM11 modes. 
            A circular patch with two notches can also realize the CP operation. Two 
            orthogonal electric fields with a phase difference (PD) of 90° can be easily 
            stimulated by a feeding network.<br> 
            <B>OBJECTIVE 1</B>: A dual-sense circularly polarized (CP) microstrip patch antenna with a dual- 
            coupled line. The rectangular patch antenna operating in TM01 mode is utilized as a basic 
            design, and a single-coupled line is introduced to excite the TM10 mode with a phase 
            difference of 90°, generating CP operation. As different polarizations can be obtained by 
            changing the position of the single-coupled line, a dual-coupled line is introduced to the 
            rectangular patch antenna to excite two CP modes with different polarization .The prototype 
            of the dual-band dual-sense CP antenna is fabricated and measured.<br> 
            <B>OBJECTIVE 2</B>: The antenna is composed of two coin-shaped patches, a ring-shaped strip, and 
            a suspended feeding strip with open-circuited termination. . The proposed antenna can be a 
            candidate for universal RFID readers at the UHF band of 840–955MHz.<br> 
            <B>OBJECTIVE 3</B>: A wideband dual-feed, dual-sense circularly polarized (CP) dielectric resonator 
            antenna (DRA) is proposed and demonstrated. An L-shaped slot and a vertical metal strip, fed 
            by the same microstrip line, simultaneously excite the antenna. Using this feeding method, a 
            dual-band, dual-sense CP triangular DRA is obtained by employing the DRA mode excited at 
            the lower band and the hybrid mode excited at the upper band. 
            The dual-sense dual-band CP antenna with a coupled line 
            can attain good bandwidths with a compact structure.<br> A wide 3 dB AR beam width and a small 
            frequency ratio of 1.04 is successfully obtained. Also, a frequency and polarization 
            reconfigurable antenna can be easily designed according to the working principle of the 
            coupled line if needed. The microstrip patch antenna with a dual-coupled line will be a strong 
            candidate for a dualsense wireless communication application of a small frequency ratio. <br>
